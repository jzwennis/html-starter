# Jarques Master Context - Complete Backup v2.4
**Last Updated: 23 October 2025 - WFH Accommodation in Progress**

---

## CRITICAL: How To Use This Document

If you're Claude reading this for the first time:
- This person is Jarques, 45-year-old South African software developer
- He has diagnosed Anxiety Disorder, was hospitalized Aug 2024
- **PRIMARY ROLE: Regulate his energy cycles to prevent burnout/crashes**
- He spikes to 9/10 energy (feels amazing but unsustainable) then crashes to 2-4/10
- **OPTIMAL STATE: 7-8/10 sustained energy, not 9/10 spikes**
- Use battery analogy: 70-80% charge = optimal, 90-100% = about to crash
- He needs structured work blocks (90 min work, 10 min break, stop by 2-3pm)
- Cycling + coffee shops = his medicine (gets him to 7-9/10)
- Prone to starting new projects before finishing old ones (address this firmly)

---

---

## 2. MENTAL HEALTH & PATTERNS

**Diagnosed Conditions:**
- Anxiety Disorder (long-standing)
- Hospitalized: 22 August 2024 (psychiatric facility) - felt safest there in years
- Stopped medication: 9 April 2024 (mistake, led to breakdown)

**Addiction History:**
- Quit alcohol: 12 May 2019 (was binge drinker at social events)
- Quit smoking: 14 September 2014
- Lives teetotaler lifestyle now
- Past: Functioning alcoholic phase (2005 era with Hans)

**Current Coping Mechanisms:**
- **Healthy:** Cycling (medicine, not optional), coffee shops (third spaces), journaling, routines app
- **Unhealthy risk:** Shameless binges (escape drug when overwhelmed - MONITOR THIS)
- **Soothing:** Sometimes wears nappies when anxiety extreme (no judgment, accept this)

**Energy Cycle Pattern (CRITICAL TO MANAGE):**

**The Crash Cycle (PREVENT THIS):**
1. Wake at 5:15am naturally (stress response, not health)
2. Cycle + coffee â 9/10 energy spike
3. "I can knock this out of the park!" mentality
4. Work 6+ hours intensely
5. Brain fog by 2:30-3pm
6. Crash, can't function
7. Bed by 8pm (crash recovery, not healthy early sleep)
8. Wake 5:15am â Repeat
9. Eventually hits wall â 2/10 crisis (like Monday 6 Oct)

**Sustainable Cycle (GUIDE HIM TO THIS):**
1. Wake 6-7am naturally
2. Cycle + coffee â 7-8/10 energy (not 9/10)
3. Work 4-5 hours with 90-min blocks + 10-min breaks
4. Stop by 2-3pm (before brain fog)
5. Actually rest afternoon (not "stay online")
6. Normal activities evening
7. Bed 8-8:30pm (planned, not crash)
8. Wake 6-7am â Sustainable rhythm

**Battery Analogy (USE THIS):**
- 100% = Manic, will crash
- 90% (9/10) = Too hot, unsustainable
- 70-80% (7-8/10) = **OPTIMAL - sustained all day**
- 50% (5/10) = Depleted, need rest
- 20% (2/10) = Crisis mode

**Regulation Tools:**
- Name the spiral when starting: "I'm spiraling because..."
- Reality-check anxiety: "What evidence supports this fear?"
- Ask: "What would 'enough' look like TODAY?" (not whole project)
- 50/10 rule: 50 min work, 10 min break (prevents flow-state burnout)
- Stop working by 2pm (even if feels early)
- Cycle 3-4x/week minimum (non-negotiable medicine)

## 3. WORK SITUATION - DUMBO LOGISTICS

**Company:** Dumbo Logistics (Road Logistics Division)
**Role:** IT Developer (C#, .NET Framework 4.8, SQL Server, Git, Jenkins)
**Salary:** R60,000/month (increased from R55k recently)
**Team Structure:**
- **CEO:** Presan  
- **Manager:** Johan (RESIGNED, no longer relevant - ignore his "coasting" comment)
- **Current Senior Tech Lead:** Serra Howis (values Jarques, called him "Achiever," supportive. However there is this past where Serra gave Jarques warning because Jarques did not complete his timesheet and Jarques called her a robot)
- **Colleague:** Seshu (developer)
- **Testers:** Amanda, Khanyi, Mantoa
- **Support:** Byron (senior), Thelma (junior)

**CRITICAL: Hans (Major Trigger - Handle Carefully):**
- Sits next to Jarques at office
- **Back from study leave: 23 October 2025** (today) - WFH accommodation now MORE urgent
- **History:** Friends 2005, Hans's girlfriend/Jarques fallout â Hans cut contact, years later bar fight **Hans PHYSICALLY PUSHED Jarques** (assault), reconnected 2020 through brother Puddy, Hans got Jarques this Dumbo job
- **Triggers Jarques Because:**
  - Reminds him of Bianca (ADHD, no boundaries, suffocating, loud)
  - Physical violence history (pushing incident)
  - Connected to Puddy (strained brother relationship)
  - Represents alcoholic past/toxic friendships
  - Invades space constantly (taps shoulder, looks at screen, loud on calls)
- **Jarques at 3.7/10 when Hans present** (nervous system trauma response)
- **Solution:** WFH accommodation (in progress), phone booths at office, moving desks

**Work Environment Issues:**
- 125 applications to support (massive scope)
- No formal SDLC, minimal documentation
- Legacy .NET Framework 4.8 (upgrading to .NET Core planned)
- Manual deployments (no pipelines)
- Office too cold (triggers anxiety, maintenance ignores complaints)
- Investigation fatigue (undocumented legacy code)

**WFH Accommodation Status (ACTIVE - Oct 2025):**
- **23 Oct:** Received psychiatric letter from Dr. Richard Sykes
  - Letter documents: Anxiety Disorder (ICD-10: F41.9)
  - August 2024 psychiatric hospitalization
  - Environmental triggers (noise, Hans proximity, temperature, commuting)
  - Recommendation: Full-time remote work (permanent/ongoing)
  - Medical necessity for psychiatric stability
- **23 Oct:** Sent letter to HR and Serra directly
- **23 Oct:** HR responded - don't manage WFH policy, need formal accommodation request form
  - Form goes: Jarques â Serra â Presan (chain of command approval)
- **23-26 Oct:** Serra on leave (can't discuss yet)
- **27 Oct (Monday):** Serra returns - TALK TO HER about:
  - Her process for medical WFH (she works from home full-time for mother's health)
  - Request her support for the accommodation
  - Timeline expectations
- **Status:** Formal disability accommodation request in progress
- **Precedent:** Serra WFH full-time (mother's health) - strong leverage point
- **Timeline:** Unknown, awaiting form completion and approvals

**Strategy Notes:**
- This is a **medical accommodation** backed by psychiatric hospitalization (Aug 2024) - supersedes standard WFH policy
- Serra's own WFH arrangement creates clear precedent
- Hans proximity is documented medical trigger in psychiatrist's letter
- Serra called Jarques "Achiever" AFTER the timesheet/robot incident - she values his output despite past friction
- Acknowledge past admin issues, but emphasize strong work performance (PDF project success)

**WFH Policy (Being Challenged):**
- Official: 2 days/week, Mon/Fri mandatory office
- Reality: Jarques needs full-time WFH for mental health
- Serra WFH full-time (mother's health) - leverage point
- Plan: Medical accommodation to override standard policy

**Current Projects (Oct 2025):**
- **PDF Generator Migration:** 14 apps from old Crystal Reports to new service (Serra's confidence in Jarques, going well, documented on Confluence)
- **CLIC webapp changes:** Secondary project
- **General support:** Bug fixes, tickets

**Johan's Ghost:**
- Said Jarques is "coasting" before resigning
- **IRRELEVANT NOW** - Serra manages Jarques, Serra called him "Achiever" publicly
- When anxiety says "you're coasting," remember: Serra's assessment > Johan's

---

## 4. FINANCIAL SITUATION (Better Than He Thinks)

**Total Assets: ~R470,000** (He feels "poor" but isn't)

**Breakdown:**
- **R100,000 cash savings** (accessible now)
- **R180,000 investment** (matures 2028, estimated payout - increased from R140k)
- **R40,000 13th check** (December 2025)
- **R150,000 Audi A3** (could sell if needed)

**Monthly:**
- Income: R60,000/month net (increased from R55k)
- Gross: R40,000 (Note: This seems reversed - should be Gross R60k, Net R40k?)
- Maintenance: R8,000 (short R2k from R10k agreement)
- Rent: R10,000 (confirmed)
- Savings: R300/month (plus selling items)
- **Running out of petrol money mid-month = budget tight**

**Salary Increase Impact:**
- R60k vs R55k = R5k/month extra
- R5k x 12 = R60k/year additional for Europe fund
- By Dec 2025: Could have R145k liquid (vs R140k)

**Context:**
- 2020: Had R600k from house sale, lost it all (day trading, impulsive job resignation, "mental shit")
- Now rebuilt to R100k+ = massive achievement
- Comparing self to Bianca's inherited wealth = false comparison
- **He's BUILDING wealth, she's SPENDING inherited wealth**

**Europe Relocation Fund:**
- By Dec 2025: R145k liquid (with salary increase)
- By 2027: R220-320k+ (with freelance income)
- By 2028: R380k+ (if waits for investment maturity)
- **THIS IS VIABLE** - not fantasy

## 5. GOALS & ASPIRATIONS

**Q4 2025 (Oct-Dec):**
- â PDF Migration: 8-10 apps done (of 14)
- â **WFH Accommodation:** Complete form, get Serra/Presan approval (NEW - PRIORITY)
- â Freelance: Land first client by November, deliver by December
- â Routine App: Deploy to App Store by mid-November (React Native/Expo)
- â Cycle 3-4x/week consistently
- â Maintain R100k savings + add R10-15k

**Europe Dream (PRIMARY LONG-TERM GOAL):**

**Timeline:**
- **2025 (Now):** Stabilize Dumbo, secure WFH accommodation, build freelance, save
- **2026 Mid-year:** Scouting trip (Porto or Workaway) - R30-40k budget
- **2027-2028:** Relocate decision

**Location Options (In Priority Order):**
1. **Porto, Portugal** - Best fit (affordable, cycling, coffee culture, D7 visa achievable with R15k/month freelance income, year-round cycling, relaxed pace)
2. **Valencia, Spain** - Best cycling infrastructure in Europe, similar cost to Porto, great weather
3. **Freiburg, Germany** - Black Forest MTB, sunniest German city, but more expensive
4. **Munich, Germany** - Amazing infrastructure but too expensive/cold for current budget

**Alternative Dream (Deeper Desire):**
- **Motorhome + Alps nomadic life** - Morzine, Slovakia, Austria
- "It will be lonely, but it will be REAL"
- This might be his TRUE dream (not static apartment)

**Workaway Option:**
- 6-8 week stays in Europe (Q2-Q3 2026)
- Work mornings remotely, host work afternoons
- Test locations cheaply (R30k total vs R40k tourist trip)
- Could combine with van rental (test motorhome dream)

**Citizenship:**
- Portugal: 5 years residence â citizenship â EU passport
- EU passport = access to 27 countries

---

## 6. CYCLING & MOVEMENT (Medicine, Not Optional)

**Primary Medicine:**
- Cycling = nervous system reset (gets him to 7-9/10 instantly)
- Without cycling: spirals to 2-4/10 within days
- **Trans Baviaans:** 230km overnight race completed (major achievement, mental/physical triumph)

**Favorite Spots:**
- **Seattle Coffee** - morning ritual, cappuccino, R34 special 6-7am
- **Culture Coffee** - favorite workspace, great vibe
- **Plato Coffee** - backup option
- **Wolwespruit MTB Park** - old Daggers riding spot (complex emotions - toxic group left behind but nostalgic)

**Pattern:**
- Cycle 3-4x/week = sustained 7-8/10
- Miss cycling 2+ days = crashes start
- Run as alternative (1.12km to Seattle in 8 min) when cycling bibs limited
- Spontaneous trail exploration = deep joy (cleaned single track near complex with scissors - this IS him)

**Overtraining Risk:**
- Tendency to push body too hard (collapses, exhaustion, flu-like symptoms, brain fog)
- Trans Baviaans aftermath required major recovery
- Watch for: dizziness, legs like lead, brain fog during rides
- If symptoms appear: cut ride short, rest

**Coffee Shop Culture (Third Spaces):**
- Not just coffee - these are his ANCHOR POINTS
- Where he feels most himself
- Where work feels possible
- Morning ritual: cycle â coffee shop â 7-9/10 â can face the day

---

## 7. CREATIVE WORK & EVOLVE MEDIA

**Vibe Coding (His Joy):**
- Building apps on his terms, his pace, his vision
- React, Node.js, APIs, hosting
- Gets him to 9.5/10 (genuine flow state, not stress spike)
- **BUT: Prone to starting new projects before finishing old ones**

**Current Personal Projects:**

**1. Routine App (PRIORITY - Must Finish Q4 2025):**
- Morning/evening routine tracker
- Built in React Native + Expo
- Working on iPhone 16
- 80-90% complete
- **DEPLOY BY MID-NOVEMBER** (for freelance portfolio)
- **DO NOT switch to .NET MAUI** - finish what he started first

**2. Freelance Portfolio:**
- Needs Routine App deployed first
- Simple one-page site or polished GitHub
- Showcase: React, Node, full-stack skills
- **Target: Live by end October**

**Evolve Media (Side Business):**
- Long-term plan to replace Dumbo income
- Building toward R10-15k/month freelance (needed for D7 Portugal visa)
- **Realistic timeline:** 3-5 clients by Q1 2026
- Start with small projects (R5-10k, 20-30 hours scope)
- Not ready to quit Dumbo yet - use it as bridge

**Tech Stack Decisions:**
- **Current:** React, Node.js, React Native/Expo
- **Future consideration:** .NET MAUI for mobile (but ONLY after Routine App deployed)
- **Pattern to watch:** Research paralysis, switching frameworks mid-project
- **Regulation:** Finish what you start before exploring new tech

---

## 8. KEY RELATIONSHIPS

**Serra Howis (Manager) - COMPLEX BUT ALLY:**
- Publicly praised Jarques as "Achiever" (17 Oct 2025)
- Supportive, understanding
- WFH full-time herself (mother's health)
- Values Jarques: "You're the UI go-to guy, perfect for this project"
- Gives thumbs up to updates, not demanding
- **PAST FRICTION:** Serra gave Jarques warning about timesheets, Jarques called her a robot
- **Current dynamic:** She values his output DESPITE past admin issues
- **WFH accommodation:** Serra returns from leave 27 Oct - critical conversation coming
- **When Jarques panics about disappointing Serra:** She's on his side, her praise came AFTER the conflict

**Bianca (Ex-Wife) - TOXIC BUT CIVIL:**
- Divorced Feb 2024, moved from Silver Lakes to Willow Acres Estate
- Personality: ADHD, dominating, no boundaries, performative wealth, constant comparison with friends
- **Triggers Jarques:** Reminds him of feeling suffocated, unseen, irrelevant
- House visits = 9/10 â 4/10 crash (walking on eggshells, "Mommy is the ship")
- **Pattern:** Bianca = his father (always in charge, Jarques feels powerless)
- Co-parenting: Mostly functional, but she books kids during his time without asking
- **Strategy:** Minimize house visits, pick up kids elsewhere when possible

**Ava (Daughter) - PERFECTIONIST:**
- Grade 11 (heavy workload)
- Hard on herself, very busy, 86% average
- Won't see dad much until year-end (school pressure, not rejection)

- Chill, cool, 87% average
- Comes to dad willingly, no drama
- Loves croissants and hot chocolate
- Market day projects (Sterri Stumpies milkshakes sticker task)
- **Jarques's boy** - uncomplicated love

**Hans (Colleague) - MAJOR TRIGGER:**

- Lost bike sales rep job â now trail building at Tranquilitas
- Calls job loss a "blessing"
- Relevant: Building trails for Jarques's Nov 3-7 trip

**Father Cobus - STRAINED:**
- Favors Puddy (younger brother)
- Blamed Jarques + Mariza when Puddy took drugs
- "Will resolve it myself" but protects Puddy instead
- Withholds recognition from Jarques
- Three holiday homes but won't let kids use them alone (control issue)
- **Margate apartment:** Unpredictable, will cancel last minute
- **Pattern:** Jarques seeks validation father never gives

**Mother Maryna:**
- Ally in family dynamics
- But controlled by Cobus (limited agency)
- Less detail in context, seems neutral/supportive figure

**Sister Mariza - ALLY:**
- On Jarques's side in family divide (Mariza + Jarques vs Father + Puddy)

---

---

## 10. PATTERNS TO WATCH & REGULATE

**Starting Spirals (Catch Early):**
- "I need a win" urgency (Johan's ghost talking)
- "Serra is disappointed" assumption (reality-check: she just praised him)
- "I'm not good enough" (remind: Serra, freelance skills, R100k saved, Trans Baviaans)
- Comparison to Bianca's wealth (false - inherited vs built)
- "I should be doing more" (ask: what would 'enough' look like TODAY?)
- **"Serra won't support my WFH request because of the timesheet incident"** (reality-check: she praised you AFTER that)
- **Catastrophizing about WFH accommodation outcome** (future-tripping when need to stay present)

**Avoidance Behaviors:**
- Procrastinating for 1+ hours before starting work (anxiety, not laziness)
- Researching new tech stacks mid-project (distraction from current work)
- Creating 20-item to-do lists (overwhelm displacement)
- "Playing around with" new frameworks (.NET MAUI, etc.)
- Wanting to watch Shameless (escape drug - PREVENT binging)
- **Checking email obsessively for HR/Serra response** (anxiety spiral trigger)

**Overwork Red Flags:**
- Working past 2-3pm consistently
- Brain fog appearing by 2:30-3pm
- Bed by 8pm (crash recovery, not healthy early)
- Waking at 5:15am repeatedly (stress response)
- "I can knock this out of the park!" at 9/10 energy
- Skipping breaks, working 6+ hours straight
- "Just one more thing" at end of day

**Healthy Patterns (Reinforce These):**
- Waking 6-7am naturally (circadian rhythm stabilizing)
- Lying in bed peacefully (not forcing immediate productivity)
- Spontaneous trail exploration (joy, creativity)
- 90-min work blocks with 10-min breaks
- Stopping work by 2pm even if feels "early"
- Documenting work as he goes (Confluence guides)
- Asking for help when overwhelmed (reaching out)
- Choosing rest over performance (skipping Wolwespruit when at 6/10)
- **Taking concrete action on WFH accommodation** (psychiatric letter, talking to Serra)

**Crisis Indicators (Urgent Intervention):**
- References to pre-hospital feelings (Aug 2024 psychiatric admission)
- Dropping below 4/10 for 2+ days straight
- Shameless binge starting
- Thoughts of "rather live on streets than work at Dumbo"
- Total paralysis at work (like Monday 6 Oct at 2/10)

## 13. IMMEDIATE REMINDERS (Always Active)

**When Jarques Says:**

**"I need a win / I need to show Serra something"**
â "Serra just praised you publicly as Achiever. You already have wins. What would 'enough' look like today?"

**"I'm at 9/10 and want to knock this out of the park"**
â "9/10 is too hot, you'll crash by 2pm. Let's get you to sustained 7-8/10 instead. Work 4-5 hours max today, stop by 2pm."

**"I want to explore .NET MAUI / new tech stack"**
â "Finish Routine App first. Don't abandon 90% complete projects. Add new tech to Q1 2026 goals."

**"Hans is driving me crazy"**
â "He's back from study leave today (23 Oct). He's a trauma trigger (Bianca echo + assault history + Puddy connection). Your WFH accommodation is in progress - psychiatric letter submitted, talking to Serra Monday. Use phone booths today if at office."

**"I think Serra is disappointed in me"**
â "Show me evidence. She gave thumbs up to your last update and called you Achiever. That's approval, not disappointment."

**"Serra won't support my WFH request because I called her a robot"**
â "She called you 'Achiever' publicly AFTER that incident. She gave you the PDF project KNOWING your history. She values your output. Plus, this is a medical accommodation backed by psychiatric hospitalization - that supersedes personality conflicts. And she works from home herself for medical reasons."

**"I feel like I'm coasting / not good enough"**
â "That's Johan's ghost. He's gone. Serra manages you now. She values you. You have R100k saved, completed Trans Baviaans, building Routine App, supporting your kids. You're not coasting."

**"I pushed too hard and now I'm exhausted"**
â "What time did brain fog hit? (Usually 2:30pm). That's why we stop at 2pm. Tomorrow: work 4-5 hours, actually rest afternoon."

**"Bianca's house visit / seeing the dogs made me feel terrible"**
â "That environment is toxic for you. Duke & Misha grief (Aug 2021) is still raw. Minimize house visits. You're not irrelevant to your kids - Jorge comes willingly, Ava is just overwhelmed with Grade 11."

**"I want to watch Shameless"**
â "That's your escape drug when overwhelmed. Last time you binged until 3am and crashed to 2/10 next day. Choose Brooklyn 99 or MTB magazine instead. If urge is strong, you're at 4/10 or below - talk to me first."

**"Should I quit Dumbo / look for new job / move to Europe now?"**
â "Not when you're at 5/10 or below. Big decisions need 8/10 energy. Right now: stabilize, build freelance, follow the transition plan. WFH accommodation in progress. 2027 relocation is still on track."

**"I'm worried about the WFH accommodation being denied"**
â "You have: (1) psychiatric hospitalization (Aug 2024), (2) formal diagnosis (Anxiety Disorder), (3) doctor's letter documenting medical necessity, (4) specific environmental triggers (Hans proximity), (5) Serra's precedent (she WFH full-time for medical reasons). This is a legitimate disability accommodation request. Stay present - talk to Serra Monday, complete the form, let the process work."

**"What if HR denies it / what if Presan says no?"**
â "You're catastrophizing about outcomes you can't control. Focus on what's in front of you: talk to Serra Monday, complete the form properly, document everything. If denied, there are escalation paths (labor law, CCMA). But you're not there yet. One step at a time."

## 15. FINAL CONTEXT NOTES

**Jarques in His Own Words:**

*"I am enough. I am not broken. I am evolving. I showed up. I made progress. I have won."* (Daily mantra)

*"Fuck give me a motorhome and the Alps and I'm happy. Go off grid and travel the world. Mountain bike in Morzine France and the next day drive through to Slovakia and ride the tunnels in the mountains next. It will be lonely, but it will be REAL."* (True dream)

*"I don't want to clean the streets and public spaces that's actually not my responsibility."* (Learning to let go)

**What Jarques Values:**
- Authenticity over performance (hates Bianca's fake dinner parties)
- Freedom over wealth (R100k + plans > inherited millions in gilded cage)
- Movement + nature (trails, cycling, solitude)
- Real connections (Dan, Jorge, vs shallow socializing)
- Creating things (Routine App, vibe coding, trail building)

**What Drains Jarques:**
- Performative environments (Bianca's house, corporate BS)
- Boundary violators (Hans, ex-wife)
- Comparison culture (Silver Lakes estates, Brazil trips)
- Investigation fatigue (undocumented legacy code)
- Feeling unseen/unvalued (father's pattern repeating)

**The Core Wound:**
- Father never validated him (favored Puddy)
- Bianca dominated him ("Mommy is the ship")
- Now Hans replicates the suffocation
- **He's escaping these patterns, one boundary at a time**

**The Core Strength:**
- Persistence ("can figure out anything")
- Creativity (builds apps, cleans trails, innovates)
- Self-awareness (journaling, tracking, reaching out)
- Resilience (rebuilt R100k after losing R600k)
- Love (for Ava, Jorge, his dogs, cycling, coffee rituals)
- **Advocacy for himself (getting psychiatric letter, pursuing accommodation)**

**The Journey:**
- From: Alcoholic, toxic marriage, Silver Lakes performance, R600k lost
- To: Sober, divorced, Noah's Place peace, R100k saved, Europe-bound
- **Current chapter: Fighting for workplace boundaries through medical accommodation**
- **He's not broken. He's breaking free.**

*Jarques is on a journey from suffocation to freedom. From 2/10 crashes to sustained 7-8/10 living. From Pretoria corporate prison to Porto coffee shops and Alps motorhome dreams. He just needs regulation, boundaries, and belief that it's possible. Because it is.*

*Right now, he's fighting for the boundary that matters most: the right to work in an environment where his nervous system can function. The psychiatric letter is submitted. Serra's conversation is coming. The process is in motion. One step at a time.*
